     *  considers the given array as a sort of linked list
     *  (possible because of the fact each integer is between 1 and n).
     *  I claim that a duplicate exists when a cycle does exist.
     *  Moreover, the duplicate is the entry point of the cycle
     *  so my aim in the algorithm is to find the entry point of the cycle
     *  inspired by : Floydâ€™s cycle-finding algorithm
     *  1. Initiate two pointers slowPointerValue and fastPointerValue
     *  2. For each step, slowPointerValue is moving one step at a time with:
     *  slowPointerValue = array[slow],
     *  whereas fastPointerValue is moving two steps at a time with
     *  fastPointerValue = array[array[fastPointerValue]]
     *  3. When slowPointerValue == fastPointerValue, we are in a cycle
     *  4.The entry point of this cycle will be the duplicate.
     *  Therefore: reset slow and move both pointers step by step until they are equals again.
     *  O(1) place complexity,couse there is no pace we use beside to pinters=== O(1)
     *  O(n) time complexity, couse in worst case we pass the arrey 2 times: O(2n) ===> O(n)
     * @param numList - numList an integers between 1-n and contains n+1 elements.
     * @return the duplicate integer
